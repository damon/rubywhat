the basic idea is to use Twitter to source URLs/descriptions of useful resources in a category

no users yet in the models, but add basic oauth so you can verify who it is
   -> soopa, feel free to add a user model and enough fields to do twitter oauth if you have time

possibly have it moderated or possibly have it seeded with a list of known rubyists who are auto-approved

add a bit to a resource and/or a particular person's submissions if for whatever reason they are messing
  with us and submitting spam or crap

maybe add voting later, but i just want the basics there for now

features:

  - home page has a search and a list of resources
  - changing the search filters out the resources that match (either live or not, doesn't matter)

Any design help you can offer would be great, soopa

awesome!
